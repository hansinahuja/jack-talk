# Jack-Talk
Making online games more accessible. JackTalk is an extenstion for Edge (or any chromium based browser) which integrates a voice assistant into online games. Currently, games created on [pokernow](https://www.pokernow.club/) are supported.

## Working prototype
The add-on is still in review in the Edge Add-on store. Will post the link once approved!

## How to install
The unpacked extension lies in the JackTalk directory which can be loaded into Edge if developer options are enabled.

## Commands Supported:

The assistant starts listening for commands after the spacebar is pressed. We supports commands in natural language. Some example commands are listed below:

* Go all in
* Bet 30
* Bet the pot amount
* Bet the minimum amount
* Call
* Check
* Fold
* What is my balance?
* What cards are there on the table?
* What cards do I have?
* What are my available options?
